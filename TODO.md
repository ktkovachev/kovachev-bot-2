# To-do
- Report that "ReadableConfig" error, which was super unhelpful and very annoying when you don't know why it's bugging.
- Find a better notation for the error-handling in read_config_template() â€“ although the custom error message is desirable, it's very bad
to have to implement it using such a ridiculously long line...
