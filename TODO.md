# To-do
- Find a better notation for the error-handling in read_config_template() â€“ although the custom error message is desirable, it's very bad
to have to implement it using such a ridiculously long line...
- Look at clap feature to allow deriving an arg-group from an enum to vastly simplify the structs required for parsing
auth method.
